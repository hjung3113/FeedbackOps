# Post-MVP Backlog

## Purpose

This document records what the owner decided **not** to ship before the MVP release, and why, so later work starts from a decision instead of rediscovering the gap. It is the companion of `13-mvp-roadmap.md` → MVP Close-Out. Delivery status is the GitHub milestones; this is a record of deferrals, not an execution queue.

Add an entry whenever a close-out slice defers or drops something. Remove an entry only when it ships or a later decision closes it.

## Deferred by scope decision (2026-10-13)

| Item | Decision | Reopen when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 2: automatic summary, root cause candidates, priority score, advanced clustering, external tool integrations, advanced Audit / Export, Executive Report | Out of the MVP; priorities come from real use after release. | Real users ask for it, or a pilot finding shows the gap blocks a daily job. |
| Public survey links and external respondents | Rejected: ADR-0035 and ADR-0036. MVP respondents stay AD-authenticated internal Actors (FOP-OUT-008). | A need for respondents outside the company; start from a new ADR. |
| Explicit MVP Exclusions (`13-mvp-roadmap.md`) | Unchanged. | Each needs its own decision. |

## Deferred during the close-out slices

| Item | Reason | Reopen when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single-object permission enforcement and approval narrowing (Slice 55, ADR-0066; owner #1041, 2026-10-13) | Current checks enforce workspace/Managed System only. End-to-end object gates across consuming routes would expand this close-out slice and its privacy tests; an object-scope warning cannot enforce a restriction. MVP rejects object-scoped writes/approval rather than silently broadening access, preserving historical rows. | A demonstrated job needs one-object access and an ADR defines object identity, every consuming-route/check/list gate, privacy tests, and explicit legacy-data disposition. Legacy unsuperseded object grants must be inventoried and resolved explicitly before MVP release. |
